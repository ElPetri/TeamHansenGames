            <h1>How We Built This</h1>
            <p>
                This project was built to be simple for beginners.
                I relied on AI for every step, especially VS Code Copilot, with GitHub and Cloudflare making publishing easy.

                <div class="prereq">
                    <strong>Before You Start:</strong> You’ll need a place to store and work on your website files. I use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Debian, but any Linux distro works.
                </div>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Set up your project folder in your Linux environment to keep your website files organized.</li>
                    <li>Open your project folder in a code editor (like VS Code) and start working.</li>
                    <li>Create your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Don’t worry if you’re new—take it one file at a time.</li>
                    <li>Open your HTML files in a browser to see your progress. Make changes and refresh to test.</li>
                    <li>Set up Git in your project folder to track changes. This helps you save your work and go back if needed.</li>
                    <li>Push your project to GitHub to back it up and share it with others.</li>
                    <li>Use a static hosting service to put your site online for everyone to see.</li>
                </ol>

    Help me plan to build my first website from scratch in simple steps. I'm a beginner. Create a small static site with index.html, style.css, and script.js for a personal project called "My First Website". Include a header, short intro, one image section, and a contact button. Use a Cozy Space Journal theme: dark navy background, soft purple cards, mint accent buttons, rounded corners, and a subtle star pattern in the background. Keep the design clean and mobile-friendly. Then explain exactly where to save each file, how to install WSL and setup a Linux distro like Debian, how to open it locally in VS Code, and how to publish it with GitHub and then deploy using Cloudflare Pages. The final plan should give copy/paste-ready code and explain each step in plain language. What ideas, suggestions, questions, and planning considerations do you have for me to accomplish these goals?

                AI was integral from start to finish. I used AI in every phase of this project, with VS Code Copilot as the main coding partner.

            <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
            <p>
                Start with one page and one feature. Use AI as your pair programmer and ship small updates often.
            </p>
            <p class="ai-note">
                In VS Code, I always started in Planning mode using Opus 4.6 to develop a solid game plan. Once happy with the plan, I switched to Agent mode and used 5.3 Codex for coding and debugging. This workflow helped minimize Premium AI Requests and made the process easier for beginners.
